# Math Game Python Project & JIRA Integration

## Overview

This repository contains a **Math Game** implemented in Python as part of the CSP300 - SOFTWARE LAB III Assignment at VNIT, Nagpur.  
The project demonstrates project management and issue tracking using **JIRA**, including integration with GitHub for traceability, bug filing, and workflow reporting[3][4].

---

## Features

- Interactive math quiz game with multiple levels.
- Issues, bugs, and feature requests tracked in JIRA for project management.
- Automated assignment and workflow implemented in JIRA.
- Linked GitHub commits to JIRA issues for traceability.
- Test cases for software validation and bug reporting.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Git

### Installation

## How To Run

Execute the Python script in your terminal:


The game will prompt questions across three levels.  
Input answers as prompted; ten points are awarded for every correct answer. Score is displayed after each input.

## Project Management Using JIRA

- Project created in JIRA with shared configuration for workflow consistency.
- Issues tracked in JIRA:
  - Bug reports (e.g., button not working, scoring error)
  - Feature requests
  - UI/UX enhancements
  - Testing and validation
- Each GitHub commit message references a JIRA Issue Key (e.g., `CSP300-5: Fixed scoring bug`) for automatic linking.
- Sprints managed using Scrum boards in JIRA.
- Plugins (e.g., Zephyr) used for test management and reporting[4].
